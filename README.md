# Sefire Graph-Style Organization

## üß≠ Core Idea
A flat, decentralized software org where the CTO and Tech Council sit at the center, and teams are graph-like nodes connected through collaboration, APIs, and shared standards.

## üèóÔ∏è Org Structure Summary
- **CTO** and **Tech Council** act as the strategic hub
- All other teams are **equal nodes**, interacting laterally
- Communication flows via RFCs, Slack, GitHub, and APIs
- Teams own their own modules with clear boundaries

## üìå Node Types

### üîπ Product Teams (Stream-Aligned)
- Example: `Billing Squad`, `Checkout Squad`, `Analytics Squad`
- Own user-facing features end-to-end

### üîπ Platform Team
- Builds internal developer tools and golden paths (e.g., CI/CD, feature flag systems)
- Treats internal teams as customers

### üîπ Infra/Ops Team
- Owns foundational infrastructure (Kubernetes, networking, DNS, node pools)
- Ensures reliability, uptime, and scalability

### üîπ Security Team
- Conducts threat modeling, secure coding practices, secret scanning
- Works across repos and teams

### üîπ Guilds / SIGs (e.g., Observability Guild)
- Cross-cutting working groups to solve shared problems
- Temporary or rotating membership

## üóÇÔ∏è Team Responsibilities and GitHub Permissions

|--------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Product Team             | `checkout-team`         | Own a customer-facing repo; handle PRs, issues, releases                         | Admin or Maintain on repo     |
| Platform Team            | `dev-platform`          | Build internal SDKs, CI/CD, observability tools; support dev teams               | Write or Maintain             |

| Security Team            | `appsec`, `security`    | Code scanning, vuln triage, permission audit, secret rotation                    | Triage or Maintain on repos   |
| Enabling / DevEx         | `devex-team`            | Create templates, linters, onboarding kits; run internal RFCs                    | Maintain on templates/tools   |
| SIGs / Working Groups    | `sig-observability`     | Review architecture proposals, build best practices across teams                | Read/Triage, Discussions      |
| Owners / Maintainers     | `maintainers-auth`      | Review PRs, set direction for owned modules, rotate maintainership               | CODEOWNERS, Enforced Reviews  |
| Bot or Automation Users  | `ci-bot`, `release-bot` | Trigger tests, sync GitOps, auto-tag releases                                    | Write on scoped repos         |
| Org Admins               | `org-admins`            | Configure permissions, billing, repo access, org-wide settings                  | Full org admin                |

## üîÅ Key Org Concepts

### What is an RFC?
An **RFC (Request for Comments)** is a lightweight, structured document used to propose significant changes, new features, architectural decisions, or policy shifts. RFCs help decentralize decision-making by allowing contributors across teams to **review, discuss, and reach consensus asynchronously**.

An RFC typically includes:
- Problem statement and motivation
- Proposed solution and alternatives considered
- Technical and operational implications
- List of affected teams and modules
- Review period and decision timeline

RFCs are tracked and stored in versioned markdown documents (often in a `docs/rfcs` folder within a repo) and are shared across the org via GitHub or an internal portal.

RFCs ensure everyone can contribute to technical direction, and that decisions are transparent, reviewable, and time-boxed.
- **DRIs / Maintainers**: Every module has accountable maintainers (documented in `OWNERS.md`)
- **RFC System**: All major decisions go through a documented RFC process
- **InnerSource**: All code is internally open for contribution
- **Async Collaboration**: PRs, Issues, Discussions, RFCs over meetings

## ‚úÖ Benefits
- ‚ö° Faster time-to-market
- üí° Bottom-up innovation
- üë©‚Äçüíª High developer autonomy and satisfaction
- üîÑ Modular scalability

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Graph-Based Org: Potential Cons & Mitigations

| Challenge                                           | Mitigation Strategy                                                                 |
|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Lack of clear authority or escalation paths        |**Escalation Flow**: Contributor ‚Üí Team Lead ‚Üí Tech Council ‚Üí CTO/Exec (if needed). Team leads are the first line of issue triage. If unresolved at that level, they escalate directly to the Tech Council, who either resolve or pass critical cases to the CTO. This keeps the decision chain short and focused.|
| Risk of duplicated efforts across teams            | Maintain a graph registry of team ownership + internal project index                |
| Overhead in consensus-building (too democratic)    | Time-boxed RFC reviews; default to lazy consensus unless objections are raised      |
| Onboarding difficulty due to decentralized info    | Developer portal with discoverable ownership, docs, APIs, and contribution guides   |
| Loss of context during cross-team handoffs         | Enforced shared documentation standards and handoff templates                       |
| Fragile coordination in crisis or incident response| Runbooks + rotating incident commander roles from Tech Council                      |
