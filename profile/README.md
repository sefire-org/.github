> **Building tools that matter — from obsession to impact.**  
> _Turning 💡 ideas into 🛠️ usable products with 🔥 grit and 🎨 creativity._

We’re a Singapore-based tech collective building tools that matter — software that’s useful, beautiful, and born out of obsession.<br>
We believe in **OCTOPI** - **O**_riginal_ **C**_ode_ **TO** **P**_roduct_ **I**_ncubation_<br>
We experiment, prototype, and incubate original software products that solve real-world problems — fast.<br>
> 🔬 Idea → Code → Product → Incubation

## 🚀 Mission

## 🔮 Vision  
Reimagine what a small, bold team can do when creativity, cross-discipline thinking, and dogged execution collide.
